# The Kest Language

This describes what is decided, not what is implemented. `docs/worklog.md` says
what runs today. Anything here without an entry there is a target.

## Shape

```kest
module world.quests

import math

const GRAVITY: f32 = -9.81

struct Player {
    x: f32
    y: f32
    velocity: f32
    health: i32
}

fn update(p: Player, dt: f32) -> bool {
    p.velocity = p.velocity + GRAVITY * dt
    p.y = p.y + p.velocity * dt

    if p.y < 0.0 {
        p.y = 0.0
        p.velocity = 0.0
    }

    for e in enemies {
        if math.distance(p, e) < 1.0 {
            p.health = p.health - 10
            print("hit, health {p.health}")
        }
    }

    return p.health > 0
}
```

## One form

`kest fmt` prints a file the one way the language writes it. `-w` writes each
file it is given and names the ones it changed; `--check` names them without
writing and exits non-zero, which is the question "is this already right".
It writes through a file beside the target and renames over it, so a program
that stops half way leaves the file rather than half of it: four spaces a
level, one space around a binary operator, none inside a bracket, and a
bracket only where taking it away would change what binds to what. It prints
from the tree rather than from the characters, which is the only way to tell
`ref<Npc>` from `a < b`.

Comments are kept, at the indent of what they are written above. What is
inside a string, including the expressions in its holes, is left exactly as
written, and so is the spelling of a number.

A list that does not fit in eighty columns goes one item to a line, all of
them or none: half on one line and half on the next is the arrangement nobody
asked for.

```kest
let w = World(
    [
        Enemy(Vec2(0.0, 0.0), 30),
        Enemy(Vec2(1.0, 1.0), 40),
        Enemy(Vec2(2.0, 2.0), 5)
    ],
    0
)
```

A chain of operators too long for the line breaks after each operator, one
level in, or two when it is a condition, because a condition has a block
starting one level in right after it:

```kest
let total = alpha * 1000 +
    beta * 2000 +
    gamma * 3000

if alpha != 1 ||
        beta != 2 ||
        gamma != 3 {
    return 1
}
```

The operator ends the line rather than starting the next one, because that is
what the language allows: a line that ends in an operator continues and one
that ends in a value does not.

A long string cannot be broken.

## One name, two functions

Two functions may share a name when they take different things. Which is meant
is settled by what is passed:

```kest
import std.math

let health = math.max(hit, 0)
let height = math.min(y, 1.0)
```

There is no ranking and nothing converts, so exactly one can match or none can.
When none does, every function of that name is listed with what it takes.

## Modules

A file may say what it is called, and what it reads:

```kest
module game.world
import game.render
```

A module's name is where its file is: `module examples.game.npc` lives at
`examples/game/npc.kest`, and the file the command names settles where the
package directories start by having its own name taken off its path.
`import examples.game.npc` therefore reads the same file whoever writes it. Its
names live under the last part of what it calls itself, so a file that imports
it writes `render.draw` and `render.Sprite`, and the file itself may write
`draw` and `Sprite`. Where a name came from is written at every use of it. Two modules whose names
end the same way would put their names under the same one, and that is refused
rather than mixed.

There is no `print`. Saying something is the host's to do, and `std.io` is
where a program asks for it:

```kest
import std.io

io.print("hello")
```

A host provides `Io.write`. `std.math` declares six functions the host must
provide: `Math.sqrt`,
`Math.floor`, `Math.ceil`, `Math.sin`, `Math.cos` and `Math.pow`. A program
that imports it requires all six, whether or not it reaches them, because the
host may call any function in the program and nothing can be left out on the
grounds that this program does not use it.

A module whose name starts with `std.` comes from the standard library
wherever the program is, and no project may use that name. The library is Kest
source. It is looked for at `$KEST_LIB`, then beside the program, then where
the build was told it would be installed, and the first one that is actually
there wins.

```kest
import std.text

if let health = text.number(field) {
    print("{health}")
}
```

Every command takes more than one file, and there are two kinds.

`check`, `run`, `emit` and `tick` read a *program*: the files named and
everything they import. `kest check *.kest` checks a project as a project;
checking only the entry point checks only what it reaches, and a file nothing
imports is never looked at.

`kest call <file> <function> [argument]...` calls one function and prints what
it gives. The arguments are read the way the language reads a literal: any
width of the right family, then the width it would have had on its own, so
`min 3 7` is the `i32` one and `min 3.5 7.5` is the `f32` one. A parameter that
cannot be typed at a shell is refused with the signatures listed.

`fmt`, `parse` and `lex` read each file on its own and follow nothing, because
what a file is does not depend on what it imports. One that cannot be read is
reported and does not stop the rest.

## Rules

A newline ends a statement. There are no semicolons, and a `;` is a syntax
error. A statement continues onto the next line while it is incomplete: inside
brackets, or after a binary operator.

Conditions take no parentheses. `if x < 3 { }` is the only spelling; `if (x <
3) { }` is refused, because `(x < 3)` is a redundant grouping the formatter
would strip and the strict parser does not accept two spellings of one thing.

Blocks are braces, always, including single-statement bodies.

An `if` gives a value when its arms say so, with the `->` that means "gives"
in a signature and in a match arm:

```kest
fn max(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 no.alloc {
    return if a > b -> a else -> b
}

let name = if let held = door -> describe(held) else -> "nothing"
```

Both arms are the same kind: `->` arms give values, block arms do things, and
mixing them is refused. An `if` that gives one needs an `else`, because a
value has to exist on both ways through. There is no ternary; `?` means
"optional" and means only that.

Keywords are English. Identifiers are UTF-8, so `let hız = 5` and
`fn oyuncuGüncelle()` are legal.

Comments are `//` to end of line. Nothing else.

Operators, tightest first:

```
~  -  !                 on one thing
*  /  %
+  -
<<  >>
&
^
|
<  <=  >  >=
==  !=
&&
||
```

The bitwise operators bind tighter than the comparisons, so
`state & MOVING == MOVING` asks what it looks like it asks. C puts them the
other way and that is the one place its table is known to be wrong.

`&`, `|`, `^` and `~` apply to integers and to nothing else; `bool` has `&&`,
`||` and `!`, which say what they mean about one bit. A shift takes a value
and a count, and the count is an integer of any width, the way an index is.
`>>` brings the sign in on a signed type and nought on an unsigned one. A left
shift wraps at the declared width like every other arithmetic, and a negative
count is a failure with a message.

A string may hold expressions in braces, and `\{` writes a brace:

```kest
print("{len(world)} left, and the escort reads \"{escortOf(world, guard)}\"")
```

There is no `+` on text. Building a string reaches the heap, so a function
promising `no.alloc` may hold a string and may not build one.

Text is its bytes. `len(t)` counts them and walks the string to do it, `t[i]`
reads one as a `u8`, and two pieces compare by them. There is no character
type: `"hız"` is four bytes, and a program that wants characters says what it
means by one.

`hash(x)` gives a `u64` standing for a value. It applies to exactly what `==`
applies to — integers, floats, `bool`, text, a set of bits, and an enum whose
cases carry those — because a type that compares has one and a type that does
not has neither. A struct combines what its fields decide:
`hash(a) * 31 ^ hash(b)`.

`find(t, needle)` gives where it is, or nothing, and costs nothing.
`slice(t, from, count)` makes a new piece of text, which reaches the heap:

```kest
if let at = find(entry, "=") {
    let name = slice(entry, 0, at)
}
```

Text built a piece at a time is built as bytes. `text(bytes)` makes one piece
out of a `[u8]`, and it is the only way to make text from something that is
not a string with a hole in it:

```kest
let out: [u8] = array()
let i = 0
while i < len(subject) {
    push(out, subject[i])
    i += 1
}
return text(out)
```

Gathering the bytes costs nothing; the copy is paid for once at the end, which
is why `std.text` writes `join`, `repeat`, `upper` and `lower` this way rather
than out of `slice`. A zero byte in the array is refused at run time, because
text ends at its first zero and one in the middle would quietly cut the rest
off.

## Keywords

```
break  const   continue  else    extern  false   fn      for
if      import  in       let     module  return  struct  true
while
```

Reserved but not yet given meaning: `type`, `defer`.

## Types

Signatures declare types. Bodies infer them.

```kest
fn scale(v: Vec3, k: f32) -> Vec3 {
    let x = v.x * k        // inferred f32
    return vec3(x, v.y * k, v.z * k)
}
```

Primitives: `i8 i16 i32 i64`, `u8 u16 u32 u64`, `f32 f64`, `bool`, `text`.

Naming a number type makes one, the same way naming a struct does:

```kest
let average = total / f32(len(items))
let index = i32(position.x)
```

Nothing converts on its own. An integer going into a narrower integer wraps,
which is what C does; a float going into an integer is truncated toward zero
and stops at the end of the range rather than being undefined, which is what
C does not.

`f32` and `f64` are different types and different instructions. `f32`
arithmetic rounds to `f32`, because the engine on the other side of the
boundary does, and an answer that differs from that one is the wrong answer.
Nothing converts between them on its own.

A host boundary is always declared and never inferred:

```kest
extern fn Clock.now() -> u64 no.alloc
```

## Values and references

A `struct` is a value. It lives where its frame does. A temporary is moved
rather than copied. A value passed to a function that neither keeps it nor
writes through it is lent, and costs nothing.

`ref<T>` is a handle into managed or host storage. It can go stale, because
something else may delete the target, so reading through it is a lookup that
can fail rather than a dereference. The failure cannot be ignored.

This split is why `Vec3` returned from a helper costs nothing: see D006.

## References

`store<T>` owns values and hands out `ref<T>`. `add` puts one in, `remove`
takes it out, and `get` reads through a reference and returns `T?`, because
what it named may be gone:

```kest
let world: store<Npc> = store()
let guard = add(world, Npc("guard", none))
set(world, guard, Npc("guard", smith))

if let npc = get(world, guard) {
    print(npc.name)
}
```

Nothing is notified of a removal and nothing counts references, so two values
may point at each other and neither has to be told. `get`, `set` and `remove`
allocate nothing; `add` can grow the store and does.

`array(n, v)` makes an array of `n` of `v`, and `push` puts one more on the
end. What it holds comes from what it is filled with, so nothing is written
down twice:

```kest
let samples = array(4, Sample(0, 0.0))
push(samples, Sample(1, 0.5))
```

An empty one has nothing to read that off, so `array()` takes what it holds
from where it is going, the same way `store()` does:

```kest
let out: [u8] = array()
```

`pop(a)` takes the last one off and gives a `T?`, because an empty array has
none to give. `remove(a, i)` takes out the one at a position and gives it,
keeping the order of what is after it. `clear(a)` empties one. None of them
reaches the heap, so a `no.alloc` function may shrink an array:

```kest
let task = remove(queue, i)
if let last = pop(queue) { }
clear(queue)
```

`remove` shifts, so it costs what the shift costs, and that is on the call
rather than hidden. When the order does not matter, an array is the wrong
container: a store hands out references that survive a removal, and removing
from one costs nothing.

Both reach the heap. An array the host lent cannot grow, because growing moves
the elements and the block is not Kest's to move; that is a failure with a
message rather than a write past the end of what was lent. It cannot shrink
either, because the length is the host's and so is the extent it lent.

`for i in from..to` counts instead of walking, from the first number up to
but not including the second:

```kest
for i in 0..len(a) {
    total += a[i]
}
```

Both ends are one type, a literal at one end takes the type of the other, and
the end is worked out once rather than every turn. A count is a way to write a
walk and not a value, so `0..n` is written where a walk is asked for and
nowhere else.

`for` walks an array, a store or a set of bits, and nothing else.

`a[i].health = 0` writes that field and nothing else, and `a[i].health` reads
that field and nothing else: neither takes the whole element apart. That is
what a frame does most, and it is why an array holds the host's bytes rather
than handles.

`for one in a` costs the same as that for the same work. A body that only ever
reads fields of the walked name, and writes nothing that could be the array,
never copies the element — so the two spellings are two spellings and not two
prices. Any other body gets the element.

What the walked name means does not depend on that. It is the element as it
was when the turn began, so writing the element in the same turn does not
change what the name reads. Anything the compiler cannot be sure of, it copies.

`for i, x in a` asks for the position as well. The name is a copy of the
walk's own count, so assigning to it changes nothing and the compiler says so.

`for` walks a store and gives a reference, because a reference is what
removing and writing take. Removing while walking is allowed: the slot goes
dead behind the cursor and the walk does not go back to it.

```kest
for r in world {
    if let npc = get(world, r) {
        if npc.health <= 0 {
            remove(world, r)
        }
    }
}
```

## A thing that is one of several

```kest
enum Door {
    Shut
    Locked(i32)
    Open(f32)
}
```

`Door.Locked(7)` builds one. What a case carries is written by position, and
named where it is used:

```kest
match door {
    Shut {
        return "shut"
    }
    Locked(key) {
        return "locked with {key}"
    }
    Open(width) {
        return "open {width} wide"
    }
}
```

A `match` that leaves a case out is refused, and the message points at the case
it did not answer. `else` answers whatever is left, and is a written decision
rather than a silent one.

An arm written `Case -> expression` gives a value, and a match whose arms all
give one is a value:

```kest
return match door {
    Shut -> "shut"
    Locked(key) -> "locked with {key}"
    Open(width) -> "open {width} wide"
}
```

Every arm is the same kind. Mixing `->` arms with block arms is refused, so
whether a match is a value is written in the arms rather than worked out from
where it appears.

Two values of an enum are equal when they are the same case carrying the same
things, so `door == Door.Locked(7)` asks what it looks like it asks. An enum
whose cases carry something that does not compare does not compare either, and
the refusal names what it was. `hash` covers the same ground, over the same
parts, so the two cannot disagree.

Two enums are answered together in one `match` rather than one inside
another. An arm answers a case for each subject, and `else` in a position
answers any case there:

```kest
return match door, move {
    Shut, Push -> Door.Open(1.0)
    Locked(key), Unlock(with) -> if with == key -> Door.Shut else -> door
    Open(width), Pull -> Door.Shut
    Open(width), else -> Door.Open(width)
    else -> door
}
```

Every combination has to be answered, so the nine here are covered by five
arms and the checker names any that is not. Arms are tried in order, so a
later one catching what an earlier one left is the point; what is refused is
an arm nothing can reach. An `else` on its own stands for every position, and
is the one way to leave a combination out.

A case in a hole is written the way it is built:

```kest
io.print("{Door.Locked(7)}")        // Door.Locked(7)
io.print("{Door.Named("gate")}")    // Door.Named("gate")
```

Text inside one is written as text, quotes and all, because what is being
written is the source and not the content. An enum has text exactly when
everything its cases carry has text, and when one does not, the refusal names
what it was.

The tag is a four byte integer at offset zero and the payload starts after it
at its own alignment, which is what a C tagged union is. A host may therefore
lend an array of them and the program walks it in place, reading and writing
the host's memory rather than a copy of it. `examples/embed.c` does exactly
that beside `examples/embed.kest`, which declares the same shape as an enum.

## A set of named bits

`flags` names a set and names each bit in it. Which bit a name stands for is
where it was written, so there are no powers of two to get wrong:

```kest
flags State: u8 {
    Moving
    Airborne
    Hurt
    Armed
}

let state = State.Moving | State.Armed
if state & State.Hurt == State() { }
```

The width is written rather than counted off the names, because it is what a
host sees: a ninth flag over a `u8` is refused, with the fix being to widen
the type rather than to change the layout underneath a host that was reading
it. It must be unsigned.

`&`, `|`, `^` and `~` combine two of one set and give that set. `==` and `!=`
compare. Nothing else applies: a set is not a number, so arithmetic on one is
refused, and two different sets cannot be mixed. `State()` is the empty one,
the way `array()` and `store()` are. `u8(state)` gives the bits and
`State(bits)` takes them back, both only at the declared width.

A `match` does not apply, and says so. Every combination of the bits is a
value, so nothing exhausts a set the way the cases of an enum exhaust it.

`for` walks the flags that are there, in the order they were declared, one
value of the set at a time:

```kest
let rebuilt = State()
for flag in state {
    rebuilt = rebuilt | flag
}
```

There is no position to walk by, the way there is none for a store: the flag
is what names the bit.

A set in a hole is written the way it is built:

```kest
io.print("{State.Moving | State.Armed}")   // State.Moving | State.Armed
io.print("{State()}")                      // State()
```

The name is the one a program writes where the set was declared, so a set
printed from another module reads without that module's name in front of it.

`flags` is a word rather than a keyword: it declares a type only where a
declaration begins, so a field called `flags` and a module called `flags`
both keep working.

## When there might be nothing

`T?` holds a `T` or nothing. A value standing where one is wanted becomes one,
which is the only conversion the language does:

```kest
fn find(items: [Item], id: i32) -> Item? {
    for item in items {
        if item.id == id {
            return item
        }
    }
    return none
}
```

`if let` is the only way to open it, and the name exists only inside the arm
where the value did:

```kest
if let item = find(stock, 7) {
    print("in stock")
} else {
    print("not carried")
}
```

There is no operator that opens one without asking, because the whole point of
the type is that the question was asked.

## A function as a value

A function can be handed to another function. Its type is written the way its
declaration is, and what it promises is part of it:

```kest
fn ascending(a: text, b: text) -> bool no.alloc {
    return a < b
}

fn sort(items: [text], before: fn(text, text) -> bool no.alloc) no.alloc {
    for i in 1..len(items) {
        let j = i
        while j > 0 && before(items[j], items[j - 1]) {
            let held = items[j]
            items[j] = items[j - 1]
            items[j - 1] = held
            j -= 1
        }
    }
}

sort(words, ascending)
```

A value that promises `no.alloc` fits where one that does not is wanted, and
not the other way round. That is what keeps a cost contract provable through a
call whose body is not known: the promise is read off the type rather than off
the body.

A name that is several functions takes the shape of the place it is going, the
way a literal does. An extern is called and not named: which function the host
bound is settled when the program starts, so there is no value to hand around.
Two function values do not compare, and one has no text.

## One body, many types

A function may take types as well as values. A copy is compiled for each set
it is called with:

```kest
fn firstOf<T>(items: [T], fallback: T) -> T no.alloc {
    for one in items {
        return one
    }
    return fallback
}
```

What each name stands for is worked out from what was passed, so a call is
written the way any other call is. A function passed as an argument is settled
after the others, so `sort(words, ascending)` picks the `ascending` that
matches what `words` made `T`.

Nothing is boxed and nothing carries a tag: a copy over `[Vec]` was compiled
knowing a `Vec` is two `f32`. The cost is the copies, and a program that calls
one function with six types has six bodies.

A struct takes types the same way:

```kest
struct Table<K, V> {
    keys: [K]
    values: [V]
}

let ages: Table<text, i32> = table()
```

A copy is made the first time a set of types is written, and found again after
that. Which copy is being built comes from what it is built with, so
`Pair(1, "a")` is a `Pair<i32, text>` and nothing is written twice. A shape
written without its types is refused: `Pair` is not a type, `Pair<i32, text>`
is.

A generic function is called and not named: it is not one function, so there
is no value to hand around. A name that cannot be worked out from an argument
is refused, and so is a copy that would need two different things to be the
same name.

Each copy is checked against its own types, so `no.alloc` can hold for one and
not another, and a copy over a type that does not compare is refused where it
is made rather than everywhere.

A name may mean a builtin and a function a file declared, and which one is
settled by what is passed: `std.table` calls its own `remove` on a table and
the builtin one on the array inside it.

## Cost contracts

`no.alloc` on a function is a promise the compiler proves or refuses.

```kest
fn stepBody(p: Player, dt: f32) -> Player no.alloc {
    return integrate(p, dt)
}
```

The promise is written at entry points. Callees defined in the same unit are
judged by their bodies, transitively; only boundaries need a written promise.
A refusal names the path down to the body that allocates, not the function
that made the promise:

```
error[K0401]: this allocates, and `stepFrame` promises `no.alloc`
 --> frame.kest:5:17
  |
5 |     let trail = [n, n, n]
  |                 ^^^^^^^^^ reached through `second` -> `third` -> `leaf`
```

Building an array is the only thing in the language that reaches the heap.
Structs, optionals and calls do not. A foreign function is judged by what it
declares, because its body is not here to be read.

## The host boundary

The default shape is one crossing carrying a borrowed view of contiguous host
storage. Per-value crossing stays expressible and is visible where it is
written, because it costs between four and ten times as much.

Inward and outward are separate specifications. The event path is bulk-first:
the host hands Kest a batch of events to walk, rather than calling Kest once
per event.

A host lends by naming the type and saying what it thinks one is:

```c
frame[0] = kest_borrow(runtime, events, 4, "Event", sizeof(Event));
```

The stride is the program's own, so it cannot be wrong. The size is there to
be disagreed with: a host whose struct has come apart from the program's type
gets a message and a value whose `object` is NULL, rather than reading the
block as something it is not.

Calling in is the same shape. The arguments go into a frame and the result
comes back over them, so the host says how wide the frame is and the program
says how wide it has to be:

```c
uint32_t needed = kest_frame_slots(build, kest_build_name(build, "spawn"));
kest_call(runtime, kest_build_name(build, "spawn"), frame, 4);
```

A frame too narrow for what a function takes, or for what it gives back, is a
message rather than a read or a write past the end of the host's array.

`kest_report` writes what the program has said since it was last asked, which
is how a host finds out why a lend or a call did not work.

`include/kest.h` is the only header a host includes and `libkest.a` needs libc
and nothing beyond it.

## Running

`kest run` calls `main`. A `main` that returns `i32` supplies the process exit
status, and one that returns nothing exits zero.

```kest
fn main() -> i32 {
    print("hello")
    return 0
}
```

A host chooses how much the machine may use, through `KestLimits`, and can ask
how much a running program has allocated with `kest_heap_used`.
`kest_heap_reset` throws all of it away and starts again, which is safe
between calls because nothing of a program's survives one, and which
invalidates every handle the host is still holding.

A failure at runtime is reported in the same shape as a failure at compile
time, with the same codes, the same source location and the same `--json`
output. Nothing about repairing a program needs to know which of the two it is
reading.

## Diagnostics

Compilation reports every error it can find, not the first. Each has a stable
code, a span, and a suggestion where one is knowable.

```
error[K0104]: unknown function `printf`
  --> player.kest:14:9
   |
14 |         printf("hit")
   |         ^^^^^^ did you mean `print`?
```

A diagnostic about more than one place says both:

```
error[K0401]: this allocates, and `stepFrame` promises `no.alloc`
  --> chain.kest:5:17
   |
 5 |     let trail = [n, n, n]
   |                 ^^^^^^^^^
  --> chain.kest:17:4
   |
17 | fn stepFrame(n: i32) -> i32 no.alloc {
   |    ^^^^^^^^^ `stepFrame` promises it here
  --> chain.kest:18:12
   |
18 |     return second(n)
   |            ^^^^^^^^^ which calls `second`
```

The same run with `--json` emits the identical set, notes and all, for
tooling and for models repairing their own output. With `--json`, a program's own writing goes to standard error, so what is left
on standard output is the JSON. `kest check --json` adds what the program
holds beside what is wrong with it: every type with its
layout and every function with what it takes, what it returns, whether it
promises `no.alloc`, and where it was declared.
